## The Early Days of ML in SEO

Back in 2020, when I was at Action, ChatGPT didn't exist yet. But we saw the potential of machine learning to solve a critical SEO challenge: optimizing product descriptions at scale.

## The Challenge

Action had thousands of products, each needing unique, SEO-optimized descriptions. Writing these manually was:
- Time-consuming
- Inconsistent
- Difficult to scale across markets
- Hard to optimize based on performance data

## Our Solution

We initiated a machine learning pilot that would:

1. **Analyze high-performing content** - Train models on our best-performing product pages
2. **Identify patterns** - Understand what made certain descriptions rank better
3. **Generate suggestions** - Create ML-powered recommendations for copywriters
4. **Learn and improve** - Refine the model based on actual search performance

## What We Learned

### The Good
- ML could identify patterns humans missed
- Scalability improved dramatically
- Consistency across product categories increased

### The Challenges
- Quality control was critical
- Human oversight remained essential
- Training data quality made or broke the results

## Lessons for Today's AI Era

Now that tools like ChatGPT are mainstream, the lessons from our early experiments are more relevant than ever:

1. **AI augments, not replaces** - Human expertise remains critical
2. **Data quality matters** - Garbage in, garbage out
3. **Test and iterate** - Start small, measure everything
4. **Keep humans in the loop** - Especially for quality control

The technology has evolved, but the principles remain the same. AI is a powerful tool for SEO, but it works best when combined with human expertise and data-driven decision making.
