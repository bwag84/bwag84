## The Translation Trap

Many companies approach international SEO by simply translating their English keyword list into other languages. This rarely works.

## Why? Search Intent Varies by Market

What works in the Netherlands won't necessarily work in France, Germany, or Spain. Here's why:

### 1. Cultural Differences
Search behavior reflects local culture. A query that converts well in one market might have completely different intent in another.

### 2. Market Maturity
E-commerce maturity varies significantly. Some markets search for "buy online" while others assume that's the default.

### 3. Local Competition
Competitor landscapes differ by market, influencing what you need to rank for.

### 4. Technical Considerations
- **Hreflang implementation** - Critical but often broken
- **URL structure** - Subdirectories vs subdomains vs ccTLDs
- **Server location** - Still matters for some markets
- **Mobile-first** - Even more critical in emerging markets

## Best Practices from the Field

From my work at FedEx managing SEO across EU, MEISA, LAC, and APAC:

### Start with Data, Not Assumptions
- Partner with local teams or vendors who understand the market
- Analyze local search behavior, don't just translate
- Use tools like Acolad for proper localization, not just translation

### Build for Scale
- Create processes that work globally but allow local flexibility
- Document everything - what you learn in one market applies to the next
- Automate where possible (think programmatic content for city-to-city searches)

### Technical Excellence
- Get hreflang right from day one (it's harder to fix later)
- Test your international setup with Search Console
- Monitor each market separately - aggregate data hides problems

## The Payoff

Done right, international SEO doesn't just multiply your traffic - it multiplies your opportunities. But it requires:
- Local market understanding
- Solid technical foundation
- Scalable processes
- Patience

International SEO is complex, but that's also what makes it interesting. Every market is a new puzzle to solve.
