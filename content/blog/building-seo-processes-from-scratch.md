## The Challenge

When I joined FedEx in 2021, there were no established SEO processes and very little awareness of SEO best practices across the organization. This is a common challenge in large enterprises where SEO is often an afterthought.

## The Approach

Building SEO processes in a large organization requires a multi-faceted approach:

### 1. Education First

Before implementing any technical changes, we needed to build awareness. I launched the Marketing Academy initiative, delivering webinars and workshops to spread SEO knowledge across different teams and regions.

### 2. Data Foundation

Global keyword data was non-existent. We partnered with Acolad to localize an English master keyword list for our largest markets: EU, MEISA, LAC, and APAC.

### 3. Creating Governance

We founded TeSSC (Technical SEO Steering Committee) with global remit to push SEO stories through our Agile Release Train (ART). This gave SEO a voice in technical decision-making.

### 4. Quick Wins

While building long-term processes, we focused on impactful quick wins:
- Fixing XML sitemaps with poorly implemented hreflang tags
- PageSpeed optimizations
- Aligning local listing source systems for Yext

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start with education** - You can't build processes if people don't understand why SEO matters
2. **Find your champions** - Build relationships with stakeholders across departments
3. **Think global, act local** - Enterprise SEO requires balancing global standards with local needs
4. **Document everything** - Processes only scale when they're documented and repeatable

Building SEO in a large organization is a marathon, not a sprint. But with the right approach, you can create lasting change.
