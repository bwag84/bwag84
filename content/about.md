draft: false
intro: |
  I'm an **International Sr. SEO Specialist** based in the **Netherlands** with over a **decade of experience** driving organic growth for companies ranging from startups to global enterprises. My journey into SEO began by combining two of my passions: **building websites** and **writing**—things I've been doing since I was young.

  I started my career at a **small company** with a strong self-starting startup vibe, where I learned the ropes and developed a hands-on approach to SEO. This foundation prepared me for my next challenge at an **agency**, where I had the opportunity to work with businesses of all sizes, from local ventures to Amsterdam Unicorns like Mollie. After gaining valuable agency experience, I transitioned **in-house**, first at **Action**, and currently at **FedEx**, where I focus on **international SEO strategy** and drive change through **data-driven storytelling**.

  With a background in **International Relations** (both Bachelor's and Master's degrees), I bring a unique perspective to SEO—understanding how to connect with diverse audiences across cultures and markets. I'm passionate about using data to tell compelling stories that drive business decisions and deliver measurable results.
