## I just wanted to have some fun! 

Back in the 90s I would build a page in HTML and CSS and upload it via an FTP application. After a refresh, my bit undoubtedly fascinating content, became visible for the world. I understood this.

During my years as a website tinekerer I slowly "understood" from the web I really have to try WordPress. So I did.

But I never really understood it. For a personal blog that is. Why do I need a database? Why do I need 12 plugins just to get it up and running. Why must every page be 12MB full of templated bullshit bloatware?

The answers are simple: it does not have to be that way. You can just upload a file, with an FTP, to a server and it will work just fine.

It is nice to have a little more. And that is what Astro gives me. Just a little more.

## Free tier! 

I have been paying for webhosting for decades. I only recently figured out free tiers. This blog... runs on GitHub pages. I refresh by making a commit. Perfect. 

It is a little barebones and developer heavy on the back-end though. I might need an actual CMS at one point.
